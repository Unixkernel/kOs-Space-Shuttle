# kOs-Space-Shuttle
This repository contains the ksp Space Shuttle craft file and work in progress kOs autolaunch script I am currently working 
on.

# Instructions for 80KM/80KM orbit:
1. Install kOs mod
2. Load craft file
3. Import launch script
4. run launch script with "run launchshuttle."
5. Enjoy!

# Info:
Shuttle is capable of reaching a 80KM/80KM orbit with 40 Tons of cargo.
Currently working on a reentry script and current launch script is still work in progress.

# Reentry Instructions(Assuming empty cargo bay):
I reccomend the ksp Trajaectories mod for planning a shuttle reentry: https://github.com/neuoy/KSPTrajectories
Make sure reentry is a shallow angle but not excessively shallow and maintain a high 25 degree pitch to avoid shuttle overheating. Make Sure to pitch up more if overheating during reentry. 
After reentry pitch up and down multiple times to kill of speed to about 100-200M/S 
Then aim for runway and keep a steep angle of descent deploy landing gear pitch up at last moment and land.
